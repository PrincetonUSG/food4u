                            Welcome to food 4 u! 
                            food 4 u is a web app to help the Princeton community better organize distribution and retrieval of
                            free food by highlighting the time and location of free food giveaway events.
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            If you're on campus, you'll also see a blue dot marking your current location to see where you are relative to the food!
                            Click "Recenter Map" in the top navigation bar to reset the map view to be centered on your current location.

                        <p>
                            On the map, you'll see markers with the food 4 u logo in different colors. 
                            These indicate free food events around campus. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The markers that are orange are going to be active later (within a week).
                            The markers are green if their events are currently active.
                            Those with 10 minutes left are yellow.
                            The markers that are red are events with no more time left.
                            If you find an event that is running out of food and has more than 10 minutes left,
                            please flag it to automatically set the remaining time to 10 minutes and prevent 
                            our community from pursuing an event that will not feed them.

                            Click on a marker to find information about the event, including descriptions, pictures,

                            To add free food you find on campus, click "Add Free Food" in the top navigation bar. 
                            Input the title, building, and room of the food. 
                            The location will be automatically set to your current location.
                            You can override this by clicking anywhere on the mini map. 
                            Inputting a common building will also automatically move the location to that building.
                            You can reset the location using the "Use My Current Location" button. 
                            Input how long you want the free food event to be displayed between 5 and 180 minutes. 
                            Optionally, add up to five photos and a description!

                            As the original poster, you can edit the event.
